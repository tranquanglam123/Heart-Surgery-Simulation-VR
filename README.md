# VR Heart Surgery Simulation

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a VR simulation for heart surgery, providing an immersive and interactive experience for users. The simulation includes two modes: Surgery Mode and Transplant Mode, allowing users to perform various stages of heart surgery in a realistic virtual environment.

## Requirements
- **Operation Room**: A detailed virtual operation room with all necessary surgical equipment.
- **Patient**: A realistic 3D model of a patient for performing heart surgeries.
- **AI Voice Instructions**: An AI voice to guide users through the procedures.
- **Two Types of Play**:
  - **Surgery Mode**: Users can cut the heart and interact with it.
  - **Transplant Mode**: Users can remove the heart and replace it with a new one.
- **User Mobility**: Users can move around the operation room.
- **User Manual**: A menu-based user manual to guide users through the simulation.

## Features
- **Realistic Heart Model**: A highly detailed heart model for performing surgeries.
- **Operation Room Scene**: A realistic virtual operation room environment.
- **Interactive Operations**: Users can choose and perform different stages of heart surgery, such as stitching or cutting through the breastbone.
- **Background Music**: Background music to enhance the user experience.
- **Data Display**: Real-time display of data from surgical machines.

## Target Device
- **VR Headsets**: The simulation is designed for Meta Quest headsets such as Quest 2, Quest 3.
